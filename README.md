# Landing Page Assignment
<br/>

<p>This is an assignment from the foundations level course on The Odin Project, it may be a beginner project but I feel it is important to keep here on my public GitHub account as a benchmark for my future self to see compare where I am at then compared to this point in time, the 20/05/2022.</p>
<br/>
<p>Enough of the pseudo-self-reflective/physilisophical README, you can view the resulting webpage <a href="https://djm30.github.io/TOP-Landing-Page/">here</a> (If the GitHub pages account up, at this point I'm unaware if there is a limit to how many you can have) </p>
